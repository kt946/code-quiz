# Code Quiz

For this week's challenge, I built a code quiz using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the DOM API. This assignment tested us on our knowledge of Web APIs and how to reference DOM objects, set up attributes and intervals, create HTML elements using JavaScript, and interact with the local browser storage. The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions and a timer that will run once the user starts the quiz. Selecting the incorrect answers will deduct seconds from the timer and the quiz will end once the timer runs out or the user answered all the available questions. Then, the user is prompted to enter their initials and their input and score will be saved to their local storage. A second webpage linked to the quiz will display an updated list of users and high scores from information located in their local storage.
